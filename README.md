Hi!

This is my example iOS RUM sandbox. To use it, just clone this repository, open the .xcodeproj in Xcode, add your app id and client token, build the app and you're good to go!

In the app you can:
- Send logs
- Send traces
- Send a custom action
- Send a custom resource
- Switch views
- Simulate a crash (if you want it to be recorded in the UI, first detach the debugger from the application)
